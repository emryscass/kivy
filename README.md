=====================================================================

I'm a big fan of working with the http://www.icndb.com/ site.
It offers hundreds of Chuck Norris jokes.


For my first kivy project I used the www.icndb.com site to request the jokes 


The chuck.jpg was taken with a google search.  The search was filtered using the tools for open
share license.

The ChuckAppScreenshot.png file is a screenshot image of the App running on my computer.
The size has been reduce to reflect that of an iPhone.



Looking at the screenshot, I have arranged the button to have a Chuck Norris image as the background.
Each click will provide a Chuck Norris joke using the Database URL listed above.

-Button (image of Chuck Norris) on Top row
-Text output displays requested joke on bottom

Some of the jokes come with garbage within the text, so has been modified to remove '&quot;' anytime it's
present.  

It must also be stressed that some of these jokes may appear to be offensive.
