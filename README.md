=====================================================================

I'm a big fan of working with the http://www.icndb.com/ site.
It offers hundreds of Chuck Norris jokes.


For my first kivy project I used the www.icndb.com site to request the jokes 


The chuck.jpg was taken with a google search.  The search was filtered using the tools for open
share license.

The ChuckAppScreenshot.png file is a screenshot image of the App running on my computer.
The size has been reduce to reflect that of an iPhone.
